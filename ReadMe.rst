Online character-sheet manager for role-playing games
=====================================================

This is a continuation of the profiler deegc and tarlen maintained `on
SourceForge`_, which is itself a continuation of the 3EProfiler project created
by Michael J Eggertson (which was on www.3eprofiler.net, but that no longer
exists).

.. _on SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgwebprofiler/

A DnD group using it decided to hack on it a bit; we'll publish what we do here.
We have at least tarlen's blessing for this and appear to have thereby
inherited the onerous burden of maintainership ;^>
