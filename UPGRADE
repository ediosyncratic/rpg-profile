Upgrading RPG Web Profiler v0.2.0 to v0.3.0
=================================================================

1) Extract the archive
2) Copy the contents of the public_profiler and root_profiler directories into the
   existing directories. If you have made any customisations, you should back them
   up first.
3) Copy the parameters $TABLE_CAMPAIGNS and $TABLE_CAMPAIGN_REQUESTS from system-default.php
   to system.php
4) Run the update-mysqldb-0.2.0-0.3.0.sql on your database.
   Eg: mysql -u profiler -ppassword profile_database < update-mysqld-0.2.0-0.3.0.sql

That's it!

Note: Since the concept of character owners has been introduced, and the current
method of determining editors doesn't keep certain information, the character owner
is set to the last editor of the character.

If this results in the wrong profile owning the character, the owner of that profile
can transfer the character to the proper owner by using the Transfer Character
function on the Character Details screen.
