===================================
1. Requirements
===================================

PHP v4.3 -
  There are reports of the profiler working on PHP v5, but at the
  time of writing, PHP v5 is not officially supported.

Apache 2.x -
  The profiler should be able to be installed with Apache 1, but
  this configuration is not supported.

MySQL 4+ -

===================================
2. Downloading
===================================

The latest release of the profiler can be downloaded from the Sourceforge project,
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgwebprofiler/

Files downloaded should always be named rpgwebprofiler-x.x.x.tgz

If you want the development version, this can be downloaded from the Subversion repository
in the above project.

===================================
3. Set up the MySQL database
===================================

Create a MySQL database however you would do this. Use mysqladmin on the command line, or
whatever console you have if you are using a public hosting service.

Execute the setup-mysqldb.sql script on the database.

Eg:

mysql -u mydbuser -pmydbpassword profiler < setup-mysqldb.sql

This creates all the RPG Web Profiler tables, and default data.

===================================
4. Installing RPG Web Profiler
===================================

Before installation, you should extract the application into a temporary directory.

You can either install the application using an Apache Alias directive, or into an
existing web folder. If you have access to the Apache configuration, it is recommended
that you install using an Alias, as this keeps the two RPG Web Profiler folders together,
and requires fewer configuration edits to get running. If you can install using an Alias,
you should follow the instructions in section 4.1.

However, if you are installing on a hosting service, and do not have access to the Apache
configuration, you will need to follow the instructions in section 4.2 to set up the
profiler in an existing web folder.

NOTE: Regardless of how you set up the application, you should be careful to ensure that
the root_profiler folder is NOT located in a web accessible folder. This can cause security
problems.

-----------------------------------
4.1. Using an Apache Alias
-----------------------------------

For these instructions, the examples will show the profiler installed in /home/tarlen/profiler.
Adjust this folder as necessary for your installation.

1. Create the folder for installation (/home/tarlen/profiler)
2. Copy all the contents of the archive from the temporary directory into /home/tarlen/profiler
3. In the /home/tarlen/profiler/root_profiler directory, copy system-default.php to system.php
4. Edit the newly created system.php as follows:

   $DB_DSN = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=profiler'
   $DB_USER = 'mydbuser';
   $DB_PWD = 'mydbpassword';
   $URI_BASE = 'http://www.mywebsite.url/profiler/';

5. Create the following entry in my Apache configuration.

   Alias /profiler "/home/tarlen/profiler/public_profiler"

   <Directory "/home/tarlen/profiler/public_profiler">
     AllowOverride All

     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
   </Directory>

6. Restart Apache. The RPG Web Profiler should now be working.

-----------------------------------
4.2. In an Existing Web Folder
-----------------------------------

For these instructions, the examples will show the profiler installed with an existing Apache
web folder at /home/tarlen/html.


1. Create the folder for the public files (/home/tarlen/html/profiler)
2. Copy the contents of the public_profiler directory into /home/tarlen/html/profiler
3. Create the folder for the engine files (/home/tarlen/root_profiler)
   ** NOTE: THIS FOLDER MUST NOT BE ACCESSIBLE VIA THE INTERNET.

4. Copy the contents of the root_profiler directory into /home/tarlen/root_profiler
5. In the /home/tarlen/root_profiler directory, copy system-default.php to system.php
6. Edit the newly created system.php as follows:

   $DB_DSN = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=profiler'
   $DB_USER = 'mydbuser';
   $DB_PWD = 'mydbpassword';
   $URI_BASE = 'http://www.mywebsite.url/profiler/';

7. Edit the /home/tarlen/html/profiler/config.php file as follows:

   $INCLUDE_PATH = '/home/tarlen/root_profiler';

8. The RPG Web Profiler should now be working.
